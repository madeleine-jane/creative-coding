/**
 * Next steps:
 * - animation: curves fall back to being straight lines. curves follow mouse when mouse is pressed.
 * - list of global "ConnectingLine" object. Each object has:
 *    - start/end points
 *    - current control point
 *    - target control point (this is the point on the original line that was closest to the mouse coords)
 *    - advanceDistance: distance control point should be moved on the next render
 * - list is cleared and redrawn if mouse is currently pressed, otherwise advance() and draw()
 * - advance(): move current control point N closer to target control point (n can be variable- slow and then speed up, or the other way around), then update N
 * - render(): create the curve with the given control point
 * 
 * So now to make it cool and pretty. Ideas:
 * - add a switch for going between lines and curves
 * - animation: curves fall back to being straight lines. curves follow mouse when pressed.
 * - colors! line weights! lerping!
 * - SPIDER MODE
 * - uke mode? each line is a string with its own note?
 * - linear algebra mode
 * - rave mode: has the gradient lerping
