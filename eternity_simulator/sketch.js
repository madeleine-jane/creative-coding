About:

This project mostly involved mapping individual pixels to 10x10 squares of color on the canvas, which turned out to be much more complicated than I had anticipated.  

The sketch has three main elements:

1. Drawing the mountain:

I drew the mountain image using a pixel drawing app. Then I loaded the 64x64 image into the sketch and blew each pixel up to a 10x10 square.

The pixel -> color square mapping on the mountain involved indexing into three arrays simultaneously:
- The pixels in the original mountain image: a 1D array with an index for each color channel of each pixel
- A 2D 64x64 array to represent where each pixel is in the original image
- The larger canvas grid that gets pixels mapped onto it(640x640) 

It got very confusing very quickly, and I got a lot of help from chatGPT on calculating the correct indices when mapping back and forth.

At the top of the sketch, I load all the mountain image pixel info into a 2D array. Then the draw() loop iterates through that array to draw the mountain. I thought I might need to do some performance optimizations on drawing the mountain but the sketch handled it fine.


2. Eroding the mountain:
At the top of the sketch, I queue all the pixels in the mountain in the order they will erode. That way each draw() loop is pretty simple: if it's time to erode a pixel, shift the first one off the queue and mark it dead. In normal mode, one pixel is eroded every time a bird makes contact with it. In time travel mode, several pixels are eroded every frame (the exact count depends on how eroded the mountain is).


3. Drawing the background:
First I draw a gradient onto the canvas, then I sample every 10th pixel color and draw a square at that index in that color. Then I added some random noise to each square's color to give the sky some texture. In time travel mode, the background gradient colors lerp from sunrise -> afternoon -> sunset as the mountain erodes.

The background is pretty busted and is essentially being held together with craft glue and popsicle sticks.
